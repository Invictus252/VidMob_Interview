Interview 3 Task: Write a calculator program. The program should let a user enter a math problem as a string and get an answer.

I chose to use the Shunting algorithm to Reverse Polish Notation to complete this task. The other option I believe is to create another class being Node to build an AST and then perform a postorder traversal on the linked nodes.
